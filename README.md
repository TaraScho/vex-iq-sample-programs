# vex-iq-sample-programs

Simple sample programs I've written to teach vex IQ programming and object-oriented programming to the 4th and 5th grade robotics team I help coach. 

## Programming Concepts
Check out these examples to learn basic programming ideas:
- [Events](programming-concepts/events) - Learn how to make your robot respond to different events!

## Sensor Examples
Learn how to use different sensors to make your robot smarter:
- [Distance Sensor](sensor-examples/distance-sensor) - Make your robot see how far away things are
- [Optical Sensor](sensor-examples/optical-sensor) - Help your robot see colors and lines
- [Bumper](sensor-examples/bumper) - Make your robot feel when it hits something
- [Touch Sensor](sensor-examples/touch-sensor) - Teach your robot to feel when it's touched
